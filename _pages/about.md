## About The Little River Flower Farm

The Little River Flower Farm began with a simple love for growing things. What started as a small garden has flourished into a thriving flower farm and design studio, where every stem is nurtured with care and creativity.

I am a Master Gardener with over 30 years of experience, and flowers have always been my way of connecting with nature and people. There is something special about locally grown, seasonal blooms — the way they capture the beauty of a moment, the changing seasons, and the natural rhythms of Connecticut's landscape.

At Little River, I focus on sustainable and organic growing practices, ensuring that every bouquet and arrangement is not just beautiful but also kind to the earth. I believe flowers should be fresh, vibrant, and full of life, just as they are in the garden. That is why I harvest at peak bloom, creating lush, garden-inspired designs that feel as natural as they do elegant.

## Our Offerings

Whether you are planning a wedding, an intimate gathering, or simply want to brighten someone's day, I create bespoke floral arrangements tailored to your vision. My work is inspired by the seasons and the flowers growing right here on the farm — no mass-produced, one-size-fits-all arrangements, just thoughtfully designed, hand-crafted bouquets filled with the freshest blooms.

- Weddings and Special Events: Romantic, organic floral designs that bring natural beauty to your celebrations.
- Seasonal Arrangements: Fresh-cut bouquets featuring the best blooms of the season.
- DIY Buckets: For creative souls who want to arrange their own flowers, I offer buckets of farm-fresh blooms for any occasion.

## Bringing Flowers to Life

Beyond floral design, I love sharing my passion for flowers with others. Whether it is through local workshops, community events, or just chatting with visitors at the farm, I believe flowers have a way of bringing people together.
