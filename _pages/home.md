        <p>Pat is an absolute master at her craft. From personal gifts to weddings and other events, she uses her magical organic garden and her extensive knowledge of floral design to create unique and stunning arrangements. She did weddings for two of our children and we can not sing her praises enough. From initial consultation to the final day, she was equally as delightful as her artistry.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>We were blown away by the stunning florals at our wedding; Pat Miller and her team seamlessly brought our vision to life. We chose a late summer and early fall color palette with plenty of pinks. We wanted to make sure that you really felt the flowers without any tall obstructions, so Pat and the team opted for plenty of mercury glass vases and tons of bud vases all over the tables. The florals were a major detail moment and Pat really knocked it out of the park.</p>
